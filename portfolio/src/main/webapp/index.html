    <h3>Programming Background</h3>
    <p>The reason why I started programming was so that I did not have to take another History class
        where all I was going to do was write essays. In my Sophomore year of high school, my school 
        offered their first Computer Science course that taught by our IT guy. Although I did not
        like the way he taught the class, I enjoyed the material. After Sophomore year, my school 
        decided to continue to offer higher and higher CS courses, even if there were only 5 people
        in the class. From then on, I decided to major in Computer Science at Fisk University, where
        I started to fall in love with CS.<p>
