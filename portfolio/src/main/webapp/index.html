        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Erys Dennis. I am 18 years old and a rising sophomore at Fisk University majoring in 
            Computer Science. I was born in and currently live in Atlanta, Ga. I have two sisters, one older
            and one younger. My younger sister is a rising senior in high school. My older sister is currently
            pursuing her Phd. and lives in Washinton DC. At the present, I have two dogs named Bruno and Moses.
            Bruno is 1 year-old French Bulldog and Moses is a 12 week-old Bullmastiff.<p>

        <h3>Programming Background</h3>
        <p>The reason why I started programming was so that I did not have to take another History class
            where all I was going to do was write essays. In my Sophomore year of high school, my school 
            offered their first Computer Science course that taught by our IT guy. Although I did not
            like the way he taught the class, I enjoyed the material. After Sophomore year, my school 
            decided to continue to offer higher and higher CS courses, even if there were only 5 people
            in the class. From then on, I decided to major in Computer Science at Fisk University, where
            I started to fall in love with CS.<p>
